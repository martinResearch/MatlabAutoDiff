# Goal

This project implements a Matlab/Octave non-intrusive forward automatic differentiation method, ([wikipedia definition here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation#Forward_accumulation)) based on operator overloading. This does not provide backward mode or higher order derivatives. More specifically it implements the method refered as *sparse batched AD* in Griewank and Walther [2] Chapter 7,  which allows to exploit sparsity in the intermediate Jacobians to make the computation more efficient. It enables precise and efficient computation of the Jacobian of a function. This contrasts with numerical differentiation (a.k.a finite differences) that is unprecise due to roundoff errors and that cannot exploit the sparsity of the derivatives.

In contrast with most existing automatic differentiation Matlab toolboxes:

 * Derivatives are represented as sparse matrices, which yield to large speedups with respect to other forward mode methods when the Jacobian of the function we aim to differentiate is sparse or when intermediate accumulated Jacobian matrices are sparse (see the image denoising example). 
 * N dimensional arrays are supported while many Matlab automatic differentiation toolboxes only support scalars, vectors and 2D matrices

It is likely that the speed could be improved by representing Jacobian matrices by their transpose, due to the way Matlab represents internally sparse matrices. The document [1] describes a method similar to the one implemented here and could be a very valuable source to improve the code.

It has been tested on Matlab 2014a and Octave 4.0.0, but the example using the anonymous function @(x)eig(x) does not work on octave as octave does not call the overloaded eig function once anonymized.

Note that backward differentation (a.k.a. gradients back-propagation in deep learning) is going to me much faster than forward differentiation when the dimension of the output is small in comparison to the dimension of the input. Forward differentiation is of interest when solving a non linear least squares for examples through Levenberg-Marquardt minimization where we want to compute the full jacobian matrix of the residuals.

 * Simple example

```c

		>> f=@(x) [sin(x(1)) cos(x(2)) tan(x(1)*x(2))];
		>> JAD=full(AutoDiffJacobianAutoDiff(f,[1,1]))
		>> JFD=AutoDiffJacobianFiniteDiff(f,[1,1])
		>> JAD+i*JFD % comparing visualy using complex numbers
		>> fprintf('max abs difference = %e\n',full(max(abs(JAD(:)-JFD(:)))));
		ans =

		   0.5403 + 0.5403i   0.0000 + 0.0000i
		   0.0000 + 0.0000i  -0.8415 - 0.8415i
		   3.4255 + 3.4255i   3.4255 + 3.4255i
		
		max absolute difference = 1.047984e-10
```

	
 * Automatic Differentiation vs Finite Differences speedup illustration 
```c
		>> f=@(x) (log(x(1:end-1))-tan(x(2:end)))
		>> tic; JAD=AutoDiffJacobianAutoDiff(f,0.5*ones(1,5000));timeAD=toc;
		>> tic; JFD=sparse(AutoDiffJacobianFiniteDiff(f,0.5*ones(1,5000)));timeFD=toc;
		>> fprintf('speedup AD vs FD = %2.1f\n',timeFD/timeAD)
		>> fprintf('max abs difference = %e\n',full(max(abs(JAD(:)-JFD(:)))));

		speedup AD vs FD = 192.2
		max absolute difference = 5.351097e-11
```
